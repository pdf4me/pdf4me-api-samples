# Replace Text With Image In Word - Java Prototype

This project demonstrates how to replace text with an image in a Word document using the PDF4ME API in Java.

## Usage

- Place your input DOCX as `sample.docx` and image as `sample.png` in this directory.
- Run `Main.java` to perform the replacement.

## TODO
- Implement the logic in `src/Main.java` following the C# Program.cs logic.
