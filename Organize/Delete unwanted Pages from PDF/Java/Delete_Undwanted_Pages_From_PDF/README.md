# Delete_Unwanted_Pages_From_PDF

A Java prototype project for deleting unwanted pages from PDF documents using the PDF4me API.

## Project Structure

```
Delete_Unwanted_Pages_From_PDF/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Main.java          # Main application entry point (prototype - logic to be implemented)
â”œâ”€â”€ sample.pdf             # Sample PDF file for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **PROTOTYPE** - This is a prototype structure. Logic will be implemented later.

## Features (Planned)

- Delete specified pages from PDF documents
- Support for page numbers and ranges (e.g., "2", "1,3,5", "2-4")
- Async API calling support
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous API responses
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Page validation and input checks

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- Internet connection (for PDF4me API access)

## Setup in IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Open the project:**
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA
   - Select "Open" and navigate to the `Delete_Unwanted_Pages_From_PDF` folder
   - IntelliJ will recognize it as a Java project

2. **Configure SDK:**
   - Go to File â†’ Project Structure
   - Set Project SDK to Java 8 or higher
   - Set Project language level to 8 or higher

3. **Set up output directory:**
   - In Project Structure â†’ Modules
   - Set the output path to `out/` directory

## Usage (After Implementation)

### Running the Application

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/Main.java
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java -cp out Main
   ```

### Input and Output

- **Input:** 
  - `sample.pdf` (source PDF file)
- **Output:** `Delete_unwanted_pages_from_PDF_output.pdf` (will be generated in the project root)

## TODO List

- [ ] Implement PDF page deletion functionality
- [ ] Add PDF4me API integration
- [ ] Implement async functionality
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Add page validation
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add documentation

## API Configuration (Planned)

The application will use the PDF4me API with the following configuration:
- **API URL:** `https://api.pdf4me.com/api/v2/DeletePages`
- **Authentication:** Basic authentication with API key
- **Features:** Page deletion, input validation, metadata handling

## Supported Features (Planned)

- Page number and range support
- Async and sync API response handling
- Error and status feedback

## Development Notes

This prototype provides the basic structure for the PDF page deletion functionality. The main logic will be implemented in the `Main.java` file, including:

- PDF document processing
- API client implementation
- File validation utilities
- Async operation management
- Error handling
- Configuration management

The project is ready to be opened in IntelliJ IDEA and can be extended with the actual implementation logic.

## Sample Files

### sample.pdf
A sample PDF document that will be used as the base document for testing page deletion functionality.

## Expected Workflow

1. Load the source PDF document
2. Validate the page numbers/ranges
3. Prepare the API request (encode, metadata)
4. Call the PDF4me API to delete pages
5. Handle the response (sync/async)
6. Save the resulting PDF
7. Provide status feedback to the user
