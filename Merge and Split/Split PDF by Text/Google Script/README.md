# Split PDF by Text with Google Apps Script and PDF4me API

This Google Apps Script provides a powerful solution for automatically splitting a PDF document based on specific text occurrences. By leveraging the [PDF4me API](https://pdf4me.com/api), you can integrate this functionality directly into your Google Workspace environment, streamlining your document management workflows without needing a dedicated server.

This script is perfect for automating the separation of large reports, invoices, or any document where a recurring text string marks the beginning or end of a new section.

## Key Features

*   **Text-Based Splitting**: Divide a PDF into multiple documents at every instance of a specified text string.
*   **Flexible Splitting Options**: Choose to split the document *before* or *after* the page containing the target text.
*   **Direct Google Drive Integration**: Reads the source PDF directly from your Google Drive and saves the split files into a designated output folder.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Efficiently handles large files using PDF4me's asynchronous job processing, preventing Google Apps Script timeouts.
*   **Customizable File Naming**: Control how the output files are named.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Includes detailed logging for easy debugging and monitoring within the Apps Script editor.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  A **Google Account** (for Google Drive and Google Apps Script).
2.  A **PDF4me Developer Account and API Key**. You can get a free key with monthly credits from the [PDF4me Developer Portal](https://dev.pdf4me.com/dashboard/#/api-keys).
3.  A **source PDF file** uploaded to your Google Drive that you wish to split.

## Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up and configure the script.

### 1. Get Your PDF4me API Key

*   Sign up or log in to the [PDF4me Developer Portal](https://dev.pdf4me.com/).
*   Navigate to the **API Keys** section and copy your API key.

### 2. Create the Google Apps Script

*   Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and click **New project**.
*   Give your project a name, for example, "PDF4me PDF Splitter".
*   Delete any existing code in the `Code.gs` file and paste the entire content of the `split_pdf_by_text.gs` file.

### 3. Configure the Script Variables

Open the `split_pdf_by_text.gs` file in the editor and modify the following variables at the top of the `splitPdfByText` function:

```javascript
// API Configuration - PDF4me service for splitting PDF by text
var apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // <-- PASTE YOUR PDF4ME API KEY

// Set the folder and file name for the input PDF
var folderName = 'PDF4ME input'; // <-- Set your input folder name here
var fileName = 'sample.pdf'; // <-- Set your PDF file name here

// Set the output folder name for split PDF files
var outputFolderName = 'Split_PDF_Text_outputs'; // <-- Set your output folder name here
var parentFolderName = 'PDF4ME output'; // <-- Set your parent folder name here
```

*   **`apiKey`**: Your secret API key from the PDF4me Developer Portal.
*   **`folderName`**: The name of the folder in your Google Drive containing the source PDF.
*   **`fileName`**: The name of the PDF file you want to split (including the `.pdf` extension).
*   **`outputFolderName`**: The name of the folder where the split PDF files will be saved.
*   **`parentFolderName`**: The name of the parent folder for the output folder. The script will create this if it doesn't exist.

### 4. Configure the Split Parameters

In the `payload` section, customize the splitting behavior:

```javascript
// Request payload with PDF content and text split parameters
var payload = {
  "docContent": pdfContent,                           // Base64 encoded PDF content
  "docName": file.getName(),                          // Source PDF file name with extension
  "text": "page 1, line 10.",                         // Text to search for splitting
  "splitTextPage": "after",                           // Split position: "before" or "after"
  "fileNaming": "NameAsPerOrder",                     // File naming convention
  "async": true                                       // Enable asynchronous processing
};
```

*   **`text`**: The exact text string to search for. The script will split the PDF wherever this text is found.
*   **`splitTextPage`**: Set to `"after"` to split after the page containing the text, or `"before"` to split before it.

## How to Run the Script

1.  **Save the Project**: Click the floppy disk icon or press `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`.
2.  **Select the Function**: From the function dropdown menu at the top, ensure `splitPdfByText` is selected.
3.  **Run the Script**: Click the **â–¶ Run** button.
4.  **Grant Permissions**: The first time you run the script, Google will prompt you to authorize its access to your Google Drive. Review the permissions and click **Allow**.
5.  **Monitor Execution**: You can view the script's progress and any potential errors by opening the **Execution log** (`View > Logs` or `Ctrl+Enter`).

Once the script finishes, the split PDF files will be available in the output folder you specified in your Google Drive.

## API Response Handling

The script is designed to handle PDF4me's API responses gracefully:

*   **Synchronous (HTTP 200)**: For smaller files, the API may process the request immediately. The script will parse the response, decode the Base64-encoded split documents, and save them to Google Drive.
*   **Asynchronous (HTTP 202)**: For larger files, the API returns a `202 Accepted` status and a `Location` URL. The script will then poll this URL periodically until the job is complete, after which it will download and save the resulting files. This prevents script execution timeouts.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Input folder not found"**: Make sure the `folderName` variable exactly matches the name of the folder in your Google Drive.
*   **"Input PDF file not found"**: Ensure the `fileName` is correct and the file exists within the specified `folderName`.
*   **Authorization Errors (401)**: Double-check that your `apiKey` is correct and has not expired.
*   **"Error decoding base64"**: This can happen if the API response is not in the expected format. The script will save a `raw_response.json` or `raw_response.bin` file in the output folder for debugging. Check this file to understand what the API returned.
