# PDF4me Google Apps Script Samples for PDF Merging & Overlay

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Google%20Apps%20Script-blue.svg)
![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-PDF4me-orange.svg)

This repository contains Google Apps Script examples demonstrating how to use the **PDF4me API** for advanced PDF manipulation directly from your Google Workspace environment. Automate your PDF workflows by merging multiple documents into a single file or overlaying one PDF onto another with precision.

These scripts are perfect for anyone looking to automate document-centric processes, such as combining reports, adding standard letterheads, or assembling document packages without leaving Google Drive.

## Key Features

*   **Standard PDF Merge:** Combine an array of PDF documents into a single, consolidated PDF.
*   **PDF Overlay Merge:** Place one PDF (e.g., a letterhead, watermark, or form template) on top of another PDF.
*   **Google Drive Integration:** Read source PDF files directly from a specified Google Drive folder or by file ID.
*   **Automated Output:** Save the resulting merged PDF to a designated output folder in your Google Drive.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Scripts are built to handle long-running jobs using the PDF4me API's asynchronous polling mechanism, ensuring reliability for large files.
*   **Easy Configuration:** Set up your API key, file names, and folder paths with simple variables at the top of each script.

## Scripts Included

1.  **`Merge Multiple PDF files into Single PDF`**
    *   **File:** `merge_multiple_files.gs`
    *   **Description:** This script takes a list of PDF file names, reads them from a Google Drive folder, and merges them sequentially into a single output PDF.

2.  **`Merge two PDF files one over another as Overlay`**
    *   **File:** `merge_pdf_files_overlay.gs`
    *   **Description:** This script takes a 'base' PDF and a 'layer' PDF. It overlays the content of the layer PDF on top of every page of the base PDF. This is ideal for applying a consistent letterhead or watermark.

## Prerequisites

*   A **Google Account** with access to Google Drive and Google Apps Script.
*   A **PDF4me API Key**. You can get a free key from the PDF4me Developer Portal.

## Setup and Usage Guide

Follow these steps to get your PDF automation running in minutes.

### 1. Create a Google Apps Script Project

*   Go to script.google.com and click **New project**.
*   Give your project a descriptive name (e.g., "PDF4me Merge Automation").

### 2. Add the Script Code

*   Choose one of the scripts from this repository (`merge_multiple_files.gs` or `merge_pdf_files_overlay.gs`).
*   Copy the entire content of the script and paste it into the `Code.gs` file in your Apps Script editor, replacing any existing content.

### 3. Prepare Your Google Drive

*   Create two folders in your Google Drive. By default, the scripts look for:
    *   `PDF4ME input`
    *   `PDF4ME output`
*   Upload the PDF files you want to process into your input folder (e.g., `PDF4ME input`).

### 4. Configure the Script

Open the script in the Apps Script editor and modify the configuration variables at the top:

```javascript
// Set your PDF4Me API key
var apiKey = 'get the API key from https://dev.pdf4me.com/dashboard/#/api-keys'; 

// Set the folder and file names for the input PDFs
var folderName = 'PDF4ME input'; // <-- Set your input folder name here
var pdfFileNames = ['sample1.pdf', 'sample2.pdf']; // <-- For standard merge
var basePdfFileName = 'sample1.pdf'; // <-- For overlay merge (base layer)
var layerPdfFileName = 'sample2.pdf'; // <-- For overlay merge (top layer)

// Set the output file name and folder
var outputFileName = 'Merged_pdf_output.pdf';
var outputFolderName = 'PDF4ME output'; // <-- Set your output folder name here
```

*   **`apiKey`**: **(Required)** Paste your PDF4me API key.
*   **`folderName` / `outputFolderName`**: Change these if you named your Google Drive folders differently.
*   **`pdfFileNames` / `basePdfFileName` / `layerPdfFileName`**: Update these with the exact names of your PDF files.
*   **(Alternative)** You can also use Google Drive file IDs instead of file names for more robust referencing. See the commented-out sections in the scripts for guidance.

### 5. Run the Script

1.  Click the **Save project** icon (ðŸ’¾).
2.  From the function dropdown menu, select the function to run (`mergePdfFiles` or `mergeOverlayPdfFiles`).
3.  Click the **Run** button.

### 6. Grant Permissions

The first time you run the script, Google will prompt you to grant permissions for the script to:
*   Access your Google Drive (to read and write files).
*   Connect to an external service (to call the PDF4me API).

You must **Allow** these permissions for the script to function.

### 7. Check the Results

*   You can monitor the script's execution by opening the logs (**View > Logs**).
*   Once the script completes successfully, your new, merged PDF will appear in your specified output folder in Google Drive.

## How It Works

The scripts automate the following workflow:

1.  **Read Files:** Locates and reads the specified PDF files from your Google Drive.
2.  **Encode:** Converts the file content into **Base64 format**, which is required for the API request payload.
3.  **API Request:** Constructs and sends a JSON payload to the appropriate PDF4me API endpoint (`/v2/Merge` or `/v2/MergeOverlay`).
4.  **Handle Response:**
    *   If the job is small, the API may return the merged PDF immediately (**HTTP 200**).
    *   For larger jobs, the API returns an "Accepted" response (**HTTP 202**) with a polling URL. The script then periodically checks this URL until the job is complete. This asynchronous pattern prevents timeouts.
5.  **Save File:** Decodes the final PDF data from the API response and saves it as a new file in your Google Drive output folder.
