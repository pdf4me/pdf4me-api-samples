# Repair_PDF_Document

A Java prototype project for repairing corrupted or damaged PDF documents using the PDF4Me API.

## Project Structure

```
Repair_PDF_Document/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Main.java          # Main application entry point (prototype - logic to be implemented)
â”œâ”€â”€ sample.pdf             # Sample PDF file for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
â””â”€â”€ Repair_PDF_Document.iml   # IntelliJ IDEA module file
```

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **PROTOTYPE** - This is a prototype structure. Logic will be implemented later.

## Features (Planned)

- Repair corrupted or damaged PDF documents
- Support for various types of PDF corruption
- Configurable repair options and strategies
- Handle both single and batch PDF processing
- Async API calling support
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous API responses
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Repair validation and reporting
- File integrity checking and verification

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- Internet connection (for PDF4Me API access)

## Setup in IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Open the project:**
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA
   - Select "Open" and navigate to the `Repair_PDF_Document` folder
   - IntelliJ will recognize it as a Java project

2. **Configure SDK:**
   - Go to File â†’ Project Structure
   - Set Project SDK to Java 8 or higher
   - Set Project language level to 8 or higher

3. **Set up output directory:**
   - In Project Structure â†’ Modules
   - Set the output path to `out/` directory

## Usage (After Implementation)

### Running the Application

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/Main.java
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java -cp out Main
   ```

### Input and Output

- **Input:** 
  - `sample.pdf` (source PDF file that needs repair)
- **Output:** `sample.repaired.pdf` (repaired PDF file will be generated in the project root)

## TODO List

- [ ] Implement PDF repair functionality
- [ ] Add PDF4Me API integration
- [ ] Implement async functionality
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Add support for multiple repair strategies
- [ ] Add repair validation
- [ ] Add file integrity checking
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add documentation

## API Configuration (Planned)

The application will use the PDF4Me API with the following configuration:
- **API URL:** `https://api.pdf4me.com/api/v2/RepairPdf`
- **Authentication:** Basic authentication with API key
- **Features:** PDF repair, corruption detection, document recovery

## Supported Repair Types (Planned)

### Document Structure Repair
- Corrupted PDF headers and trailers
- Damaged cross-reference tables
- Invalid object references
- Broken page trees and catalogs
- Corrupted stream data

### Content Recovery
- Damaged text content
- Corrupted image data
- Broken font references
- Damaged form fields
- Corrupted annotations

### Metadata Repair
- Damaged document information
- Corrupted page metadata
- Broken security settings
- Damaged bookmarks and links

### Advanced Repair
- Password-protected document recovery
- Encrypted document repair
- Digital signature validation
- Certificate repair

## Development Notes

This prototype provides the basic structure for the PDF repair functionality. The main logic will be implemented in the `Main.java` file, including:

- PDF document analysis and validation
- Corruption detection and assessment
- Repair strategy selection
- API client implementation
- Repair validation utilities
- Async operation management
- Error handling
- Configuration management
- File integrity verification

The project is ready to be opened in IntelliJ IDEA and can be extended with the actual implementation logic.

## Sample Files

### sample.pdf
A sample PDF document that will be used for testing repair functionality. This file can be intentionally corrupted for testing purposes or used as a baseline for repair operations.

## Expected Workflow

1. Load the source PDF document
2. Analyze and detect corruption issues
3. Prepare the repair request (encode PDF, set repair options)
4. Call the PDF4Me API to repair the document
5. Handle the response (sync/async)
6. Save the repaired PDF
7. Validate the repaired document
8. Provide repair status and report to the user

## Repair Options (Planned)

The repair process will support various configuration options:

### Basic Repair Options
- **Auto-detect corruption:** Automatically identify and repair common issues
- **Preserve original structure:** Maintain original document layout and formatting
- **Recover maximum content:** Attempt to recover as much content as possible
- **Validate after repair:** Perform integrity checks on repaired document

### Advanced Repair Options
- **Repair strategy selection:** Choose specific repair methods
- **Content recovery level:** Set aggressiveness of content recovery
- **Metadata preservation:** Control which metadata to preserve
- **Output format options:** Specify output PDF version and compatibility

## Repair Report (Planned)

The application will generate detailed repair reports including:

### Repair Summary
- Original file information
- Detected corruption types
- Applied repair strategies
- Repair success rate
- Output file information

### Detailed Analysis
- List of repaired issues
- Content recovery statistics
- Validation results
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations

### Error Logging
- Failed repair attempts
- Unrecoverable content
- Warning messages
- Debug information

This prototype provides a solid foundation for implementing comprehensive PDF repair functionality with robust error handling and detailed reporting capabilities.
